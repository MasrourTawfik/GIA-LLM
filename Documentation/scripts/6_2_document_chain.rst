DocumentChain Class
===================

The ``DocumentChain`` class is designed to facilitate the implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method for information retrieval from various documents such as PDFs, text files, etc. This class encapsulates methods and attributes necessary to process and retrieve information from a collection of documents using advanced NLP models and techniques.

Attributes
----------

- ``docs`` : list
    A list that holds the loaded documents after processing.
  
- ``model`` : object
    Placeholder for the language model used for downstream tasks (e.g., question answering).
  
- ``chain`` : object
    Placeholder for the RAG chain which connects retrieval to downstream tasks.
  
- ``retriever`` : object
    An instance of a retriever that handles document indexing and retrieval.
  
- ``bge_embeddings`` : object
    An embedding model from Hugging Face used for generating embeddings for text.
  
- ``vectorstore`` : object
    A storage system for embeddings, which enables efficient querying and retrieval.
  
- ``store`` : object
    A key-value document store to hold chunked documents.
  
- ``done`` : bool
    A flag indicating if the initialization has been completed.
  
- ``doc_names`` : list
    A list of all document names that have been loaded.
  
- ``directory`` : str
    The directory path where document files are stored.

Methods
-------

- ``__init__()``
    Initializes an empty ``DocumentChain`` with defaults and directory to ``"./documents"``.

- ``init_embedding_model()``
    Initializes the embedding model with pre-trained Hugging Face embeddings.

- ``load_documents()``
    Loads all the documents from the specified directory and processes them into the ``docs`` attribute.

- ``init_retriever()``
    Initializes the ``retriever`` with a vector store and document store, and adds processed documents to the retriever.

- ``init_model()``
    Placeholder for initializing the downstream language model.

- ``init_chain()``
    Orchestrates the initialization of all components necessary for the RAG method, including the embedding model, downstream model, document loading, and retriever.

- ``add_new_document(filename: str)``
    Adds a new document to the retriever. The document is specified by the filename, and it is loaded, processed, and added to the store.

Usage Example
-------------

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the ``DocumentChain`` class:

.. code-block:: python

    # Initialize the DocumentChain
    doc_chain = DocumentChain()

    # Initialize all components
    doc_chain.init_chain()

    # Check if the initialization is complete
    if doc_chain.done:
        print("Document Chain is ready for use.")

    # Add a new document to the retriever
    new_filename = "new_document.txt"
    doc_chain.add_new_document(new_filename)

**Note**: External dependencies such as `HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings`, `TextLoader`, `PyPDFLoader`, document splitters, `Chroma`, `LLM_model`, `ParentDocumentRetriever` should be properly installed and imported for the `DocumentChain` class to function correctly.

Important Considerations
------------------------

- Make sure that all required dependencies are satisfied.
- The directory set in ``directory`` must exist and contain the documents to be processed.
- Loading large sets of documents may be time-consuming and could require substantial memory, depending on document size and quantity.
- The actual retrieval and downstream use of the RAG chain are not implemented within the provided methods.

If you encounter issues or have any questions regarding the use of the ``DocumentChain`` class, please refer to the project developer or support documentation.
