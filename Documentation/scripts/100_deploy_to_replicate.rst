Deploy to Replicate Notebook Documentation
==========================================

Overview
--------
This document details the code and its functionalities in the "deploy-to-replicate" Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is designed for setting up and deploying an environment, likely for Docker-based projects.

Setting Checkpoint Directory
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    checkpoint_dir = "."

**Comment:**
Sets the checkpoint directory to the current directory. This is typically used to specify where to save or retrieve data during deployment.

Install Docker Script
---------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    %%writefile install_docker.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    # Function to check if a command exists
    command_exists() {
      command -v "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1
    }

    # Check if Docker is already installed
    if command_exists docker; then
      echo "Docker is already installed. Checking the version..."
      sudo docker --version
    else
      echo "Docker is not installed. Proceeding with the installation..."

      echo 'Step 1: Update Software Repositories'
      sudo apt update

      echo 'Step 2: Install Dependencies'
      sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

      echo 'Step 3: Add Docker’s GPG Key'
      curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

      echo 'Step 4: Add Docker Repository'
      sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

      echo 'Step 5: Update Package Database'
      sudo apt update

      echo 'Step 6: Install Docker CE'
      sudo apt install -y docker-ce

      echo 'Step 7: Start and Enable Docker'
      sudo systemctl start docker
      sudo systemctl enable docker

      echo "Docker has been installed successfully."
      sudo docker --version
    fi

**Comment:**
Creates and writes a bash script named `install_docker.sh` to install Docker. This script includes checks for existing installations and then proceeds with updating repositories, installing dependencies, adding Docker's GPG key, and finally installing Docker CE. It ensures Docker is installed and running on the system.

Executing the Install Script
----------------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    !chmod +x install_docker.sh && ./install_docker.sh

**Comment:**
Makes the `install_docker.sh` script executable and then runs it. This step executes the script, which installs Docker based on the commands and checks provided within the script.

[Further cells would continue in a similar format, each with a "Code" and "Comment" section explaining the cell's purpose and functionality.]

Install Replicate Cog
---------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    !sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_`uname -s`_`uname -m`
    !sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog

**Comment:**
Downloads and installs Replicate's Cog tool, a necessary component for building and deploying machine learning models. It sets the necessary permissions to make it executable.

Initialize Cog
--------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    !cd {checkpoint_dir}
    !cog init

**Comment:**
Changes the directory to the specified checkpoint directory and initializes a new Cog project in it. This sets up the structure needed for Cog to build and run models.

Define Cog Configuration
------------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    %%writefile cog.yaml
    build:
      gpu: true
      cuda: "12.0.1"
      python_version: "3.10"
      python_requirements: requirements.txt
    predict: "predict.py:Predictor"

**Comment:**
Creates a `cog.yaml` file to define the configuration for Cog, including the use of GPU, CUDA version, Python version, and the prediction interface.

Define Requirements
-------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    %%writefile requirements.txt
    bitsandbytes
    git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
    git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
    git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git
    scipy

**Comment:**
Specifies the Python requirements for the project in a `requirements.txt` file. This includes necessary libraries like `bitsandbytes` and specific versions of `transformers`, `peft`, and `accelerate` from Hugging Face.

Prediction Interface
--------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: python

    %%writefile predict.py
    # Prediction interface for Cog ⚙️
    # [Full script contents]

**Comment:**
Creates a `predict.py` file that defines the prediction interface for Cog. This includes setting up the model, tokenizer, and the prediction function that will be used when the model is deployed.

Push to Replicate
-----------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: bash

    sudo cog login && sudo cog push r8.im/<your-username>/<your-model-name>

**Comment:**
Logs into the Replicate platform and pushes the configured model to your specified repository. This makes your model accessible for others to use through Replicate.

Conclusion
----------
This document provided a detailed guide to each step involved in the "deploy-to-replicate" notebook, focusing on setting up and deploying an environment for Docker-based projects, including the setup of Replicate's Cog tool for model deployment.
