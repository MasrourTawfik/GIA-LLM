Unzipping Data
--------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: python

    !unzip /content/LLM_data.zip

**Comment:**
Unzips the 'zyphire.zip' file to make the raw data accessible for processing.

Installing Datasets Package
---------------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: python

    !pip install datasets

**Comment:**
Installs the 'datasets' package necessary for handling and processing large datasets efficiently.

Merging JSON Files
------------------
**Code:**
.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import json
    import glob

    directory = "/content/you_document"
    output_jsonl_filename = "merged_dataset.jsonl"
    json_pattern = os.path.join(directory, '*.json')
    file_list = glob.glob(json_pattern)

    with open(output_jsonl_filename, 'w') as outfile:
        for file in file_list:
            with open(file, 'r') as f:
                json_obj = json.load(f)
                outfile.write(json.dumps(json_obj) + '\n')

**Comment:**
Reads and merges multiple JSON files from the 'zyphire' directory into a single JSONL file. This step consolidates the data and prepares it in a format suitable for Hugging Face.

Obtaining the Token
------------------
