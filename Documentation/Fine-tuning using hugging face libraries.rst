Fine-tuning using hugging face libraries
===========================================

To perform fine-tuning using hugging face libraries, you can follow these steps:

1. Load the pre-trained model:
    - Use the `from_pretrained` method to load the pre-trained model from the hugging face library.

2. Prepare the data:
    - Preprocess your data and convert it into the required format for fine-tuning.
    - Tokenize your data using the tokenizer provided by the hugging face library.

3. Create the data loaders:
    - Create data loaders to efficiently load and process your data during training.

4. Define the training loop:
    - Define the training loop to iterate over the data loaders and update the model parameters.

5. Fine-tune the model:
    - Train the model using the defined training loop and the fine-tuned data loaders.

6. Evaluate the model:
    - Evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model on a validation set or test set.

7. Save the fine-tuned model:
    - Save the fine-tuned model for future use.

8. Use the fine-tuned model:
    - Load the saved fine-tuned model and use it for inference or further fine-tuning.
